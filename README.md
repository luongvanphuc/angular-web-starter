# NOTES Before starting
- This project was cloned from B3Shark starter project (initial & empty project), so there will be places that are named 'b3shark'.
- You may want to search 'b3shark' (case insensitive) in all files and replace with your own project name.
- Then run these commands:
1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn start` and `yarn lint` in two separate terminal windows/tabs
